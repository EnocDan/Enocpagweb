      <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
      <h3>ESSAY: Finding Strength in Challenges</h3>
      <p>There was a time when failure terrified me. The fear of not meeting expectations, of disappointing myself and others, often kept me from taking risks. Whether it was hesitating to raise my hand in class, delaying tasks until the last possible moment, or avoiding leadership opportunities, I let fear dictate my choices. However, one experience changed my perspective forever.</p>
      <p>During a summer camp, I was assigned as the leader of a group of younger children, responsible for organizing activities, managing conflicts, and making sure everyone felt included. At first, I doubted myself—leading others seemed overwhelming, and I was afraid I wouldn’t be capable of handling it. But as the days went by, I realized that leadership isn’t about being perfect; it’s about adaptability, communication, and learning through experience.</p>
      <p>This experience taught me resilience, patience, and problem-solving skills. I learned how to listen, motivate, and support others, and I saw firsthand the impact of a strong leader. The challenges I faced—helping shy kids feel comfortable, handling disagreements, and ensuring the team worked together—gave me a new sense of confidence. I understood that stepping up, even when uncertain, is what creates true growth.</p>
      <p>Of course, my journey wasn’t without struggles. Procrastination and self-doubt often crept in, making me question my ability to succeed. But instead of retreating, I faced my fears head-on. I learned the value of time management, self-confidence, and embracing failure as part of success. When I finally understood that failing wasn’t an end but a beginning, I started pushing my limits, seeking new challenges, and embracing opportunities to grow.</p>
      <p>Now, I am eager to bring this mindset to university life. I look forward to joining student organizations that align with my passions, engaging in leadership roles, and contributing to a community that values growth and resilience. College isn’t just about learning; it’s about becoming. I want to make the most of the resources available, collaborate with inspiring peers, and develop the skills necessary for my future career.</p>
      <p>I know that university will present new obstacles, but I welcome them. Because now, I understand that failure isn’t something to fear—it’s something to learn from. And with that mindset, I am ready to thrive.</p>
